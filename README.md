Most of the robots available in the industry make use of wheels for navigation. The goal is to build a legged vehicle with multiple-terrain mobility superior to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles.

The system would be able to travel anywhere a person or animal could go using their legs while carrying its own fuel and payload. It would be smart enough to negotiate terrain with a minimum of human guidance and intervention

The Creep gait of this project is for a 12-DOF unmanned Quadruped(four-legged robot) equipped with 12 Servo Actuators and an ARM Processor for onboard computations.

The Quadruped is based on Sprawling type motion with creep and trot gait successfully implemented on it.
